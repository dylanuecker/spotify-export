# spotify_export

Not worrying about potential commas in song names, artists, etc. Resolve in the future if needbe. Will have the row
as well, so can always reformat.

Local files are not returned from the saved tracks api endpoint. I have many of these saved, but will need to
reference the Spotify Local Music folder for completeness.
